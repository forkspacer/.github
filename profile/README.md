- **Workspace Forking** - Clone and branch existing environments for experimentation
- **Hibernation Management** - Automatically scale down idle workspaces to save resources
- **Multi-Application Support** - Manage complex environments with multiple interconnected services
- **Declarative Configuration** - Define workspace specifications using Kubernetes-native YAML
- **Resource Optimization** - Intelligent resource allocation and cost management
